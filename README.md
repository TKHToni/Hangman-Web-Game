# Hangman-Web-Game
This is my first personal web project, a simple hangman game made with the random words package. All the logic runs on the backend and it has a DB scoreboard on mongoDB.
The app is deployed on heroku and can be accessed through this [link](https://dry-plains-50095.herokuapp.com/scoreboard)
